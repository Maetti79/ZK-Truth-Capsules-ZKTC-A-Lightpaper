# ZK Truth Capsules (ZKTC): A Lightpaper

## Overview

**ZK Truth Capsules (ZKTCs)** are cryptographically verifiable proof structures designed to establish trust in AI-driven decisions without revealing sensitive inputs or proprietary model internals. Built on a modular architecture and leveraging blockchain and zero-knowledge proof systems, ZKTCs enable scalable, privacy-preserving auditability for AI in high-stakes environments.

## Motivation

AI systems are increasingly used in domains like healthcare, finance, law, and governance. However, these systems are typically black boxes—users and regulators cannot verify whether a model behaved correctly, fairly, or legally without exposing private or proprietary information.

**Problem:**
- Lack of transparency
- No audit trail
- Privacy and IP concerns block explainability

**Solution:**
ZK Truth Capsules provide an architecture for proving that an AI decision:
- Used a certified model
- Received a valid input
- Followed specific rules or ethical constraints
- Produced a correct or compliant output

---

## Architecture: Layered Truth Capsule Framework (LTCF)

ZKTCs are composed of layered proofs:

1. **Input Validity Layer**
   - Hash of input data
   - Optionally timestamped and signed

2. **Model Integrity Layer**
   - Hash of certified model version
   - Anchored on-chain for immutability

3. **Constraint Verification Layer**
   - Optional logic proving adherence to ethical/policy constraints
   - May involve rule-based validation or cryptographic signatures

4. **Inference Output Layer**
   - Final output (e.g., label, decision)
   - Zero-knowledge proof that the output matches the input + model logic

Each layer can be independently audited or combined for full proof encapsulation.

## Oracle Integration: Post-Inference Signing

To reduce computational burden on real-time AI systems, ZKTCs support **Post-Inference Oracle Signing (PIOS)**:
- AI systems submit inference metadata (hashed input/output) to decentralized zk-oracles
- Oracles verify the inference against certified models
- Oracle signs the inference hash and publishes it to blockchain

This pattern enables lightweight AI inference with **retrospective verifiability**.

## Implementation Stack

| Component             | Technology Options                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Blockchain Anchor    | Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, or custom rollups     |
| ZK Proof System      | zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, zkML (experimental)          |
| Model Registry       | IPFS/Arweave + smart contract pointer               |
| Oracle Infrastructure| Chainlink-style staked zk-verifiers                |
| Privacy Layer        | zk-ID, selective disclosure, threshold encryption  |

## Use Cases

- **Healthcare**: Prove a diagnosis was produced by a certified model, without revealing patient data.
- **Finance**: Demonstrate loan decisions were made fairly and legally.
- **Governance**: Provide verifiable but private AI advice on legislation.
- **Military/Intelligence**: Prove lawful behavior without exposing strategy or data.

## Roadmap & Challenges

**Short Term:**
- Build PoC with small models (e.g., decision trees, logistic regression)
- Integrate with zk-SNARK systems and off-chain inference logs

**Mid-Term:**
- Scale to support transformer-based models with proof aggregation
- Develop policy constraint DSL (Domain-Specific Language)

**Long-Term:**
- Fully decentralized ZKTC DAO for certification, revocation, and arbitration
- Cross-chain capsule compatibility

## Vision

ZK Truth Capsules transform AI from opaque black boxes into transparent civic actors. By enabling privacy-preserving verifiability, they establish a foundation for **trusted machine reasoning** in critical systems.

> AI decisions should not just be intelligent—they should be provable.
